# Domain Adaptation in Computer Vision Using Correlation Realignment (CORAL)

This research investigates the effectiveness of Domain Adaptation techniques in the field of Computer Vision. Specifically, it evaluates the performance of Deep CORAL (Correlation Alignment), a method designed to minimize domain shift by aligning the second-order statistics (covariances) of feature representations across different domains.
